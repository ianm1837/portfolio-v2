  "Jesse, my partner, was on the lookout for the next phase in her career and needed a portfolio. As I was wrapping up my studies, I took on the challenge to craft one for her. Being a gifted and meticulous designer, Jesse produced her own design system and high-fidelity prototypes for me to follow. I opted for Next.js, eager to delve deeper into the framework. Mid-development, I recognized the constraints of Bootstrap and pivoted to Tailwind. Coincidentally, Next.js released its v13 update along with the app directory. While transitioning to these new tools, I crafted a fresh design that, though never launched (as Jesse secured a job), enriched my learning journey. For a behind-the-scenes look, explore the `tailwind-migration` branch. \n \n No additional pictures here, go check out the live site if you would like to see more. ðŸ˜‰";
